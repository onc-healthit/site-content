### C-CDA Scorecard API
Currently we are implementing API keys for the C-CDA Scorecard. During this time, the C-CDA Scorecard continues to operate as expected via the UI, but is currently *disabled* for external API POST usage, until we finish implementation and develop a program for key requests and distribution. The completion of this work is currently targeted for June 26th, 2023.

Thank you for your patience.
