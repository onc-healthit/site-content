The C-CDA Scorecard leverages the work completed by an ONC-funded grant â€” [SMART (Substitutable Medical Apps Reusable Technologies)](https://smarthealthit.org/) and promotes best practices in C-CDA implementation by assessing key aspects of the structured data found in individual documents. It is a tool designed to allow implementers to gain insight and information regarding industry best practice and usage overall. It also provides a rough quantitative assessment and highlights areas of improvement which can be made today to move the needle forward. 

[The best practices and quantitative scoring criteria have been developed by HL7](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=534) through the HL7-ONC Cooperative agreement to improve the implementation of health care standards. We hope that providers and health IT developers will use the tool to identify and resolve issues of C-CDA document interoperability in their health IT systems.
